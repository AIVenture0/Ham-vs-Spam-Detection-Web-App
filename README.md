# Ham-vs-Spam-Detection 
How to use the machine learning for industrial purpose.
Letâ€™s build a spam |ham  classifier program in python which can tell whether a given message is spam or ham !
Create a Flask Web-app and integrating it with Machine learning to differentiate between Ham vs Spam

## Getting Started
Natural Language Processing (NLP)
![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*cVoraxFg3UORfGxM.png)
is the field of Artificial Intelligence concerned with the processing and understanding of human language. Since its inception during the 1950s, machine understanding of language has played a pivotal role in translation, topic modeling, document indexing, information retrieval, and extraction.
- ```First install packages using pip according to the requirements.txt file from a local directory?```
 - ```activate your virtualenv```
 - ```run:  pip install -r requirements.txt in your shell```
 
## Dependencies 
* Ml Algorithms
* Numpy 
* Pandas
* Machine Learning Algorithm
* scikit learn
* Flask 
* Html
* Css
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* Sklearn

### Web-app 
Web-app creted by using flask, Html, Css ,JavaScript, Bootstrap look like - Once you enter text in the given input box and hit predict button , It predict weather the given text is ham or spam.
- Input your text 
<img src="../master/Images/ham vs spam 1.png" alt="Img1"/>

- Output 

<img src="../master/Images/ham vs spam 4.png" alt="Img1"/>


## Result
The output of this model is a flask web-app which predict the  "The given message or mail is  SPAM or HAM ".
